 Abstract: The class responsible for the finger painting. The class wraps the
 CAEAGLLayer from CoreAnimation into a convenient UIView subclass. The view
 content is basically an EAGL surface you render your OpenGL scene into.

 HSL2RGB Converts hue, saturation, luminance values to the equivalent red, green and blue values.
 For details on this conversion, see Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics by Foley and van Dam (1982, Addison and Wesley)
 You can also find HSL to RGB conversion algorithms by searching the Internet.
 See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space for a theoretical explanation
